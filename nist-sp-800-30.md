# NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1
---------------------------------

### Guide to assessing risk

NIST SP 800-30 is a publication that provides guidance on performing risk assessments. It outlines
strategies for identifying, analyzing, and remediating risks. Organizations use NIST SP 800-30 to gain
insights into the potential likelihood and severity of risks—helping them make informed decisions
about allocating resources, implementing controls, and prioritizing remediation efforts.

This four page document is adapted from NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1. The term "Rev. 1" signifies that it is the
rst updated version of this publication. NIST occasionally revises its documents to incorporate new
information, reflect changes in technology and regulatory requirements, or address feedback.

<b>Note:</b> NIST's [Computer Security Resources Center](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/30/r1/final) contains more information on SP 800-30 Rev. 1.

### Threat sources
NIST SP 800-30 defines and categorizes threat sources as entities or circumstances that can
negatively impact an organization's information systems. This information is useful for identifying and
assessing potential risks. When referencing it, consider the intent/capabilities of either internal and
external threat sources.

<b>Note:</b> The following table lists a few possible threat sources that could compromise a publicly
accessible database server.
