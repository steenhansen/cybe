# Incident handler's journal

### Instructions

As you continue through this course, you may use this template to record your findings after completing an activity or to take notes on what you've learned about a specific tool or concept. You can also use this journal as a way to log the key takeaways about the different cybersecurity tools or concepts you encounter in this course.

| Description        | Documenting a cybersecurity incident  |
|  |This incident occurred in the two phases: |
|  |1.  **Detection and Analysis**: The scenario outlines how the organization first detected the ransomware incident. For the analysis step, the organization contacted several organizations for technical assistance. |
|  |2.  **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery**: The scenario details some steps that the organization took to contain the incident. For example, the company shut down their computer systems. However, since they could not work to eradicate and recover from the incident alone, they contacted several other organizations for assistance. |

| Tool(s)&nbsp;used |None |

|The 5 W's        |Who: An organized group of unethical hackers|
||What: A ransomware security incident|
||Where: At a health care company
||When: Tuesday 9:00 a.m.
||Why: The incident happened because unethical hackers were able to access the company's systems using a phishing attack. After gaining access, the attackers launched their ransomware on the company's systems, encrypting critical files. The attackers' motivation appears to be financial because the ransom note they left demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key. 
|||
| Additional notes| 1. How could the health care company prevent an incident like this from occurring again?|
||2. Should the company pay the ransom to retrieve the decryption key? |

|Description|Analyzing a packet capture file |
|Tool(s) used|For this activity, I used Wireshark to analyze a packet capture file. Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer that uses a graphical user interface. The value of Wireshark in cybersecurity is that it allows security analysts to capture and analyze network traffic. This can help in detecting and investigating malicious activity.|

|Additional notes|I've never used Wireshark before, so I was excited to begin this exercise and analyze a packet capture file. At first glance, the interface was very overwhelming. I can see why it's such a powerful tool for understanding network traffic.|

|Description|Capturing my first packet|
|Tool(s) used|For this activity, I used tcpdump to capture and analyze network traffic. Tcpdump is a network protocol analyzer that's accessed using the command-line interface. Similar to Wireshark, the value of tcpdump in cybersecurity is that it allows security analysts to capture, filter, and analyze network traffic. |
|The 5 W's|Who: N/A|
||What: N/A|
||Where: N/A|
||When: N/A|
||Why: N/A|
|Additional notes|I'm still new to using the command-line interface, so using it to capture and filter network traffic was a challenge. I got stuck a couple of times because I used the wrong commands. But after carefully following the instructions and redoing some steps, I was able to get through this activity and capture network traffic.|
